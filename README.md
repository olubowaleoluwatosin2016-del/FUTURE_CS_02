SOC (Security Operations Center) Internship Project
Overview

This project provides a beginner-friendly introduction to Security Operations Center (SOC) activities. The focus is on monitoring security alerts, analyzing logs, and simulating incident response workflows using SIEM tools.

It simulates the day-to-day responsibilities of a SOC Analyst, including detecting suspicious activity, categorizing alerts, and drafting professional incident response reports.

 Project Objectives

Configured and explored a SIEM platform (Splunk Free).

Monitor and analyze security alerts and system logs.

Detect anomalies such as failed logins, unusual IPs, or malware activity.

Classified alerts by severity and priority.

Drafted an incident response report with threat details, impact, and recommended actions.

Simulate stakeholder communication during incident handling.

 Tools & Technologies

SIEM Platforms:

Splunk Free Trial ‚Äì Commercial-grade SIEM platform

Data Sources:

Simulated system logs (SOC_Task2_Sample_Logs)

Authentication logs (success & failed logins)

Network connection logs (IP tracking)

Malware detection alerts

Documentation:

Google Docs / Microsoft Word ‚Äì for professional reporting

Methodology

Setup & Data Ingestion ‚Äì Load sample logs into ELK or Splunk.

Monitoring ‚Äì Use dashboards to track security events in real time.

Alert Analysis ‚Äì Identifed patterns such as brute-force attempts, suspicious IPs, or malware detections.

Classification ‚Äì Assiged severity levels (High, Medium, Low).

Incident Response ‚Äì Drafted reports with timeline, root cause, impact, and remediation.

Communication Simulation ‚Äì Created stakeholder update (executive summary / incident email).

‚úÖ Key Deliverables

Incident Response Report (PDF) including:

Executive summary

Identified suspicious alerts 

Incident timeline and analysis

Risk classification & severity ratings

Suggested remediation steps

SIEM Dashboard Screenshot showing detected anomalies.

Alert Triage Table mapping alerts to severity (High/Medium/Low).

Stakeholder Communication Template.

 Sample Findings (Illustrative)

üö® Multiple Failed Logins ‚Äì Possible brute-force attempt from foreign IP.

üåê Unusual Network Activity ‚Äì Connection to flagged malicious IP.

ü¶† Malware Detection Alert ‚Äì Endpoint flagged for suspicious file execution.

Each incident is documented with log evidence, impact assessment, and recommended response actions.

üéì Skills & Competencies Demonstrated

Log analysis and SIEM monitoring

Alert triage and classification

Threat detection and prioritization

Incident response and documentation

Professional stakeholder communication
